`Rasengan.js 1.0.0-beta` is the first beta version of the Rasengan.js framework.

Based on modern tools, Rasengan.js will help you to create **high-quality web applications** with the benefit of React Components. It's a simple and easy-to-use framework that will help you to create a **beautiful and responsive web application**.

## Main features

Rasengan.js supports the following features:

- [**`Routing`**](/docs/core/routing/base-concepts): Rasengan.js provides a simple and easy-to-use routing system that allows you to create routes for your web application.
- [**`CSS Support`**](/docs/core/styling/css-module): Adding styles to your components is easy with Rasengan.js. You can use CSS Modules, tailwindCss, Preprocessors like Sass, Less and Stylus.
- [**`SSR`**](/docs/core/rendering/introduction#server-side-rendering-ssr): Rasengan.js supports server-side rendering (SSR) out of the box. This rendering approach is useful for SEO and performance optimization.
- [**`Data Fetching`**](/docs/core/rendering/data-fetching): Rasengan.js provides a simple and easy-to-use data fetching system that allows you to fetch data from an API.

Based on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), it benefit of its high performance in terms of bundling, code splitting which makes it a great choice for your web application.

## Built with modern tools

Rasengan.js is built with modern tools like:

- [**`React`**](https://react.dev): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [**`Vite`**](https://vitejs.dev): A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- [**`React Router`**](https://reactrouter.com): A routing library for React.

## Why Rasengan.js?

Rasengan.js is a simple and easy-to-use framework that will help you to create a beautiful and responsive web application. It is built with modern tools like React, Vite, and React Router, which makes it a great choice for your web application.
<br />
Rasengan.js was created by ([Dilane Kombou](https://twitter.com/dilanekombou)) to address performance limitations encountered when using React and Vite alone. While React with Vite can be optimized for better performance, this requires extensive configuration and optimization work.
Rasengan.js solves this problem by providing:

- Built-in performance optimizations out of the box
- A simplified and developer-friendly API
- Tools to create high-quality web applications with minimal configuration

The framework eliminates the need for developers to manually implement complex performance optimizations, making it easier to build fast and responsive web applications compared to using React and Vite with default settings.
<br />

Rasengan.js works on top of the Server Side Rendering (SSR) which is useful for SEO and performance optimization. It also provides a simple and easy-to-use `Data Fetching` system that allows you to fetch data from an API (similar to `getServerSideProps` of Next.js).
