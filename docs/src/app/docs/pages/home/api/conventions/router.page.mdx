# Router Convention naming

In Rasengan.js, to create a `router`, you have to create a file that follow the following name pattern:

```txt title="Router" showLineNumbers
[name].router.js
```

A `router` is a set of pages grouped under the same `layout` that share it.

## Example

<Tabs tabs={[{ title: 'TypeScript' }, { title: 'JavaScript' }]} activeIndex={0}>
  <Tabs.Item>
    ```tsx title="app.router.tsx" showLineNumbers
    import { RouterComponent, defineRouter } from "rasengan";
    import AppLayout from "@/app/app.layout";
    import Home from "@/app/home.page";
    import About from "@/app/about.page";

    /*
     * This AppRouter is located inside the app.router.tsx file
     */
    class AppRouter extends RouterComponent {}

    export default defineRouter({
      imports: [],
      layout: AppLayout,
      pages: [Home, About],
    })(AppRouter);
    ```
  </Tabs.Item>
  <Tabs.Item>
    ```jsx title="app.router.jsx" showLineNumbers
    import { RouterComponent, defineRouter } from "rasengan";
    import AppLayout from "@/app/app.layout";
    import Home from "@/app/home.page";
    import About from "@/app/about.page";

    /*
     * This AppRouter is located inside the app.router.jsx file
     */
    class AppRouter extends RouterComponent {}

    export default defineRouter({
      imports: [],
      layout: AppLayout,
      pages: [Home, About],
    })(AppRouter);
    ```
  </Tabs.Item>
</Tabs>

Based on the convention, we have juste replace the `[name]` by `app` in the convention name and we got `app.router.js`.

{/* <AlertBox type='error'>
	It's required to have your main `router` inside the `app/app.router.js` page,
	because it's considered as an `entry` point.
</AlertBox> */}
