# Deploying to Vercel

Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions that fits perfectly with Rasengan.js. It enables developers to host websites and web services that deploy instantly, scale automatically, and require no supervision, all with minimal configuration.

<br />
In this guide, you will learn how to deploy a Rasengan.js app to Vercel.

## Deploy

To deploy your Rasengan.js app to Vercel, you need to configure your project to use the `@rasenganjs/vercel` adapter.
