# Optimizing Images

Images are the most important part of a website. They are the first thing that a user sees when they visit a website.
So, it is important to optimize images to make the website load faster.

Rasengan.js provides an external package called <Link to="/packages/image">`@rasenganjs/image`</Link> to display images on the website with a lazy loading feature.
The package doesn't compress images but it loads them only when they are in the viewport.

## Installation

By default, when using the <Link to="/docs/api-reference/create-rasengan-cli">`Rasengan CLI`</Link> to create a new project, the `@rasenganjs/image` package is already installed.

If not, you can install it by running the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @rasenganjs/image
```

## Usage

First of all, you have to import the `css` file in your project. You can do this by adding the following line in your `main.js` file:

```js title="main.js" showLineNumbers
import "@rasenganjs/image/css";
```

Then, you can use the `Image` component to display images on your website.

### Local Image

This package supports local images. You can import the image and pass it as a `src` prop to the `Image` component.
file extensions like `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg` are supported.

```jsx title="Avatar.jsx" showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
import Image from "@rasenganjs/image";
import avatar from "@assets/images/avatar.jpg";

export default function Avatar() {
  return <Image src={avatar} alt="Avatar" width={200} height={200} />;
}
```

### External Image

You can also use external images by passing an object with an `uri` property as a `src` prop to the `Image` component.

```jsx title="Avatar.jsx" showLineNumbers copy
import React from "react";
import Image from "@rasenganjs/image";

export default function Avatar() {
  return (
    <Image
      src={{ uri: "https://example.com/avatar.jpg" }}
      alt="Avatar"
      width={200}
      height={200}
    />
  );
}
```
